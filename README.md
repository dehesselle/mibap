# mibap - macOS Inkscape Build And Package
The Inkscape devs need help with compiling and packaging on macOS ("from source to dmg"). I want to help, so let's see how far we come. I'm saying "we" because this is not a singular person's effort, it's a joint effort. I want to take a look at and (hopefully) build upon what others have come up with. Ideally we can take this past the finish line, but if not, someone else will have the chance to pick up the torch.

This is an activity log and/or notepad of sorts. Mind that this here is all work in progress, far from being polished or in a presentable state. It'll stay "dirty" until it actually does what it's supposed to do.  
Final goal is that there will be scripts and stuff here that we can PR to Inkscape.

# 10.03.2019
Due to user feedback in the chat I invested some time looking at how to build and run current versions of Inkscape (0.94) on High Sierra and Mojave using MacPorts. I gained some valuable insights, made at least one guy happy and gave some input back to Inkscape on how to update [their instructions](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-0.92.4/mac-os-x/macports/dl/).

# 07.03.2019
Out of curiosity I spent the last days with [gtk-osx](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-osx/) due to the fact that this is the "more native approach". If you build GTK with what the GTK project offers, there is the benefit of [gtk-mac-bundler](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-mac-bundler) to (hopefully) take care of a lot of things.
- successfully setup build environment with gtk-osx (it's jhbuild, tailored for osx)
  - added additional stuff not covered by jhbuild but required to compile Inkscape
- successfully compiled Inkscape
- first steps using gtk-mac-bundler
  - has problems with libinkscape_base.dylib, manual fixing of library paths
  - has problems with poppler, manual fixing of library paths
  - Without visible library problems, Inkscape still fails to run. But GTK dialog comes up, "internal error" - at least something.
- Unbundled Inkscape fails to run as well - that I didn't expect. Glib::Error "unrepresentable character in conversion input".

__Next__: compare library version between homebrew build and jhbuild?

# 06.03.2019
- overview `@executable_path`, `@loader_path`, `@rpath`: https://wincent.com/wiki/%40executable_path%2C_%40load_path_and_%40rpath
- doing exactly what I'm about to do: https://extra.freetimedev.com/index.php?category=tutorials&subject=app-bundle

# 05.03.2019
- Talked to the Inkscape Devs during their hackfest via RocketChat. The "master" issue for macOS related work is https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/issues/84.
  - The app [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/download.html) came up when we were talking about how other apps are doing what we want to do. It is GTK3, runs on macOS (menubar integration). Will try to get some insights/inspiration from that app.
- Working on `create_app.sh` script. Rewriting library paths and copying files into an app bundle directory structure is done (but not finished!) so I can perform the first test.
  - The created app does not run. Would've been to easy if it did, I know.
  - There are error messages from `GLib-GObject-CRITICAL` and more, but sadly they don't tell me "couldn't find file X", "error doing Y".
  - Using `dtruss` reveals that rewriting library paths as I did is not enough. There are still _a lot_ of systemcalls to libraries/paths in the homebrew build directory which I supposedly rewrote with my script.
    - I haven't checked all the libraries yet for things that I missed. Need to check.
    - More important: I'm aware that it doesn't look right to me, e.g. I don't have `lib/gio/modules` right now. That's what I should look into first.
  - Need to read up on relocatable libraries again, it's been to long.
  - Also: I'm using `@executable_path` instead `@rpath` right now so I did not have to figure out how to set it. (The first one is fixed thing, the later can be set dynamically.)
- I just noticed that the older Inkscape 0.92.2 doesn't launch its executable directly but a shellscript doing a lot of stuff to the environment. It even includes a FIXME about "Inkscape needs better relocation support". Ha ðŸ¤ª!
  - Kidding aside, a compiled version of the newest Inkscape does run without all that. Parts of that might get relevant later when we get to things like Extensions, Python support etc.
- `@rpath` can be set with `install_name_tool` as well.

__Next__: Go back to the working compiled version of Inkscape. Change paths for one single library, than library by library. Find the error.

# 04.03.2019
- Began work on script to create application bundle.
  - First step was creating a recursive function to parse all dynamically linked libraries from a given starting point (the inkscape binary).

__Next__: continue work on script

# 27.02.2019
- Cloned the Inkscape master branch (1.0 alpha is only a tag, not a branch) to try my luck again.
  - I'm happily surprised that compilation was fine :-). Quite a few warnings, but that's to be expected from a huge piece of software. 
  - The resulting build appears to be working (no real testing done).
- Master branch was at commit a456169068e7a1ca8715860715fbe912d6cf7fa5.
  - Since this is now known to work, I'll be using this exact commit as a base. Once I get the whole build chain (source to dmg) up and running, I'll re-open this to always us the current master code.

__Next__: create application bundle

# 23.02.2019
Starting point for everything is a clean macOS 10.13.6 installation. "Clean" as in "freshly installed + XCode". 
- Based on ipatch's notes:
  - Created script to prepare build environment. (WIP, unpolished!)
  - Created script to build Inkscape. (WIP, unpolished!)
- I encountered warnings during compilation (warnings are treated as errors). Quick&dirty fix is to disable those warnings using the corresponding compiler flags. At least one warning is suspicious (comparison between string literal) and warrants further investigation sometime later, so I'm leaving this as TODO for now.
  ```
  /Volumes/WORK/inkscape-INKSCAPE_1_0_ALPHA/src/extension/internal/gdkpixbuf-input.cpp:56:56: warning: result of comparison against a string literal is unspecified (use strncmp instead) [-Wstring-compare]
        forcexdpi = (mod->get_param_optiongroup("dpi") == "from_default");
                                                       ^  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ```
- Compilation fails with
  ```

  make: *** [all] Error 2
  ```
  Preliminary analysis suggests that a missing dependency leads to `Layout::showGlyphs()` being omitted in `src/libnrtype/Layout-TNG.h`:
  ```
  #ifdef HAVE_CAIRO_PDF    
    /** Renders all the glyphs to the given Cairo rendering context.
     \param ctx   The Cairo rendering context to be used
     */
     void showGlyphs(CairoRenderContext *ctx) const;
  #endif
  ```
__Next__: investigate `HAVE_CAIRO_PDF` (probably recompilation of Cairo with additional feature flags required?), compile current Git master. 

# 22.02.2019
- Homebrew formula is https://github.com/caskformula/homebrew-caskformula
  - a bit out of date
  - commentend on [Issue 75](https://github.com/caskformula/homebrew-caskformula/issues/75) asking for ipatch's current working build: [ipatch's work](https://github.com/ipatch/homebrew-us-05/blob/master/inkscape/inkscape-building-for-macOS.md)
- MacPorts portfile is https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/graphics/inkscape/Portfile
  - based on last commit, seems pretty current

__Next__: build using ipatch's notes

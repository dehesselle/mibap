# macOS build pipeline

This folder contains the scripts that make up the build pipeline for Inkscape on macOS. The upstream project is [mibap](https://github.com/dehesselle/mibap) which contains the complete development history. It also provides a disk image with precompiled dependencies so that Inkscape CI can focus on building the application.

# JHBuild module set

This is a customized copy of [gtk-osx](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-osx):

- remove any software packages that we don't need
- update packages as required
- keep the file layout intact so diff'ing with upstream remains helpful
- add new software packages to inkscape.modules
- do not use Python virtual environment for JHBuild
